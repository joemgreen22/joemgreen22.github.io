                    Hello! I'm Joe, I'm located in Boise, Idaho. I moved to Boise in 2014 to attend Boise State University and have been here ever since. 
                    I spent my time in university bouncing between majors, which resulted in graduating with a number of degrees, 
                    including a BS in Health Science, a BS in Computer Science with an emphasis in Cybersecurity, and a minor in Biology and Chemistry. 
                    Since graduating I have worked in the cybersecurity industry. 
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, I'm focused on improving my knowledge of the cybersecurity industry, striving to improve every day.
